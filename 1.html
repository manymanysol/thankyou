for me, the past which was about from 2010~2020 was the best. in the point of view,, you know.
the most memorable and the most funniest. but also,, i can say the hardest days ever.
I had times and many people even if it was temperary.. but I couldn't control my feelings and didnt
do anything while the wave of bad feelings pull me over. that's why i got many diarys.</P>
